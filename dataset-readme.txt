Dear Reviewer,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that the datasets associated with the project are too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub. As a result, I have provided alternative links to access the datasets for your reference:

NYUv2 Dataset: https://opendatalab.org.cn/OpenDataLab/NYUv2
MM-IMDB Dataset: https://archive.org/details/mmimdb
CMU-MultimodalSDK Dataset: https://github.com/CMU-MultiComp-Lab/CMU-MultimodalSDK

Please download the datasets from these links. If you encounter any issues with accessing or downloading the files, feel free to reach out, and I will assist you further.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Author
